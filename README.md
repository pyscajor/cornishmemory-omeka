cornishmemory.com Omeka theme
==================

A fork of the SCKLS Parent Theme by Interactive Mechanics, with customisations.

I am rebuilding cornishmemory.com using Omeka, which will house tens of thousands of historic photos, videos and audio recordings from Cornwall's past.

This repository is for the theme which I am customising. It's a fork of the excellent InteractiveMechanics/sckls-omeka. Go there first.

This is my first go at using Git & GitHub so the initial commit consists of many changed files which were made without version control.

This fork is not intended for redistribution, with a lot of site-specific modifications, but is made available here in case any changes are useful.

The main differences are using a fallback image for audio and video files which do not have thumbnails, a bigger navigation bar, and some clearer navigation within browse and show pages.

SCKLS Customization Features:
  *  Title
  *  Subtitle
  *  About this site
  *  Header background image
  *  Primary site color
  *  Toggle "featured" content on the homepage
  *  Footer logos (up to 3)
  *  Custom Google search

More to come.
